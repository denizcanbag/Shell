# Shell
This shell program crated with C language for OS project. It is writtten for linux based kernel so it wont work on Windows.
Shell.c has two main usage. One is interactive mod and the other one is batch mode(just like windows .bat file).
To us it in interactive mod you can download the compiled shell or you may compile the shell.c file on you own preferably using
gcc compiler. Just executing the compiled file opens the program in interactive mode.
To use the shell in batch mode all you have to do is giving the filepath to the program at execution(start up).

# Examples
```
Example1: ./shell ~~ Open in interactive mode.

Example2: ./shell [pathToBatch] ~~ Open program in batch mode.
```

# Notes
```
PS: When reading batch file line by line, if shell sees quit command it will quit.

PS2:While in interactive mode if arguments includes simultaneously running commands(seperated with ';') and sees quit 
command it willfinish the other child process then kills the parent program.

Example For PS2: ls;quit;ls -a ~~ will issue the commands ls and ls -a simultaneously then quit.
``` 

- [x] Making cd command working like a charm :)
- [x] Solve the infinity loop when batch command which have simultaneous jobs.
- [ ] Improve the use of pirate language.

Theme of the shell is pirate. â˜
